# OurToken - ERC20 Implementation  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is an **ERC20 token implementation**, developed as part of my learning journey from **Cyfrin**. It follows the ERC20 standard using **OpenZeppelin’s ERC20** library and includes unit tests with **Foundry**.  

## 🛠 Features  
- ✅ **Fully functional ERC20 token**  
- ✅ **Minting on deployment** (initial supply)  
- ✅ **Transfers & Allowances**  
- ✅ **Secure & Audited Implementation** (OpenZeppelin)  
- ✅ **Unit Tests using Foundry**  

## 📜 Smart Contract  
The token is implemented in **Solidity (0.8.19)** and inherits from OpenZeppelin’s ERC20 contract v5.02.
